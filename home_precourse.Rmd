This workshop is aimed towards biologists, researchers, computer scientists or data analysts planning to run, analyse and interpret an RNA-Seq experiment. Basic knowledge of working on the Unix/Linux command line is expected.

## Preparation

These are steps to be completed before the workshop.

### Uppmax ID

A remote computing cluster (UPPMAX) will be use for data analyses. A SUPR/SNIC account is needed to use UPPMAX resources.

If you do not already have one, create an account at [https://supr.snic.se/](https://supr.snic.se/).

### SSH & SFTP access

<div class="boxy boxy-grey boxy-lightbulb">
You need a program to connect to a remote cluster (UPPMAX). Linux and Mac users already have terminal on their systems.

[![](data/common/mobaxterm.png)](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net)

If you are on a Windows system, we recommend [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net). It is recommended that you INSTALL the program and not use the portable version. MobaXterm also has an integrated SFTP file browser.  

[![](data/common/xquartz.png)](https://www.xquartz.org/)

Mac users will need to download and install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) for X11 forwarding. *ie*; to forward remotely opened windows to local machine.
</div>

Type `ssh -Y user@rackham.uppmax.uu.se` in the terminal and then enter your password. The password will not be visible as you type.

<div class="boxy boxy-grey boxy-lightbulb">
If you need to transfer data between UPPMAX and your computer, you can use tools SCP or SFTP through the terminal. Windows users can use the SFTP browser available with MobaXterm.

[![](data/common/filezilla.png)](https://filezilla-project.org/)

For all users, if you prefer a GUI to upload and download files from UPPMAX, we recommend installing [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

### Tools

[![](data/common/r.png)](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

<i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> **Install R statistical software** from [r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/). If you have an old version of R and you do not use it, uninstall it and then install a newer version. Make sure you have one of the recent versions of R. One version older than the latest version is recommended. This is because all packages may not be updated for the very latest version of R. For Windows users, it is recommended that you DO NOT install to `C:\Program Files\R\`. Instead, install to `C:\R\`.

[![](data/common/rstudio.png)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

<i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> **Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)**. RStudio provides you with tools like code editor with highlighting, project management, version control, package building, debugger, profiler and more.

<i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> **Extra R packages** used in the workshop exercises (if any) are listed below. It is recommended that you install this in advance.

For Linux and Mac users, you may have to install some extra OS specific libraries before installing the R packages. Pick the packages as needed based on your system below.

- **libcurl**

> deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)  
> rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)  
> csw: libcurl_dev (Solaris)  

- **libssl**

> deb: libssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)  
> rpm: openssl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)  
> csw: libssl_dev (Solaris)  
> brew: openssl@1.1 (Mac OSX)  

- **libxml2**

> deb: libxml2-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)  
> rpm: libxml2-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)  
> csw: libxml2_dev (Solaris)  

Install the R packages. Simply copy and paste the code into R.

```{r,eval=TRUE,chunk.title=NULL,echo=FALSE,comment="",class.output="r"}
# this code block reads package names from '_site.yml' and prints them as installation instruction.

pkg <- yaml::read_yaml("_site.yml")

if(!is.null(pkg$packages$packages_cran_student)) {
 cat("# install from cran\n")
 cat(paste0("install.packages(c('",paste(pkg$packages$packages_cran_student,sep="",collapse="','"),"'))"))
 cat("\n")
}

if(!is.null(pkg$packages$packages_bioc_student)) {
 cat("# install from bioconductor\n")
 cat(paste0("BiocManager::install(c('",paste(pkg$packages$packages_bioc_student,sep="",collapse="','"),"'))"))
}

if(!is.null(pkg$packages$packages_github_student)) {
 cat("# install from github\n")
 cat(paste0("devtools::install_github(c('",paste(pkg$packages$packages_github_student,sep="",collapse="','"),"'))"))
}
```
